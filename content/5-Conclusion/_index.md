In this workshop, you have learned the basis of CloudFormation and taken some hands-on labs for each topic. This is the first step for you to learn the intermediate and advanced concepts of Infrastructure as Code generally, or CloudFormation specifically. 

I hope you enjoy this workshop. Thank you and keep going!
