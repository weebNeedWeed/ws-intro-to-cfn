# Infrastructure as Code: Introduction to CloudFormation

#### Overview

In this lab, you will learn the basis of **AWS CloudFormation**, the tool that enable you to provision AWS resources by defining a file called *template*. In a template, you specify the resources you need, the properties for each resource and the location you want those resources to be deployed. CloudFormation will interpret your template and generate your resources automatically. And at the end of each section, you will take the hands-on lab to solidify your understanding.
